# gold_bar_scale_problem
Given: 9 gold bars, identical in look. 8 weigh the same, 1 is lighter than the rest.

Using a scale as few times as needed, find a way to determine the lightest gold bar. In my case, I print the name of the bar in the terminal that is the lightest. One may choose  any language to submit, and I chose Python.

## pre-requisites running this in python
* Must have python installed as well. 
  run if you do not have already. `brew install python`
 verify with `python3 --version`.
  * Note:: I used Python 3.4.2.
* this project will need user to run command line in terminal
* user will need to clone this repo to their machine

## run solution
1. Go to solution.py. Chose one gold bar to make weigh less than the rest of the gold bars. Currently the ninth gold bar is the lightest. You may change this manually if you choose to, but make sure that 8 gold bars are of equal weight and 1 gold bar is lighter than the rest.
2. To run the solution file, cd to the directory called gold_bars. 
Then run `python3 solution.py` in terminal

## run tests
 To run the test file, cd to the directory called gold_bars in your terminal. 
Then run `python3 test_solution.py` in terminal
